The Synology Diskstation(DS) devices have a Photo Station application that creates a web based album of folders in your /photos folder.

The DS creates thumbnails for these photos when they are uploaded to the NAS. Unfortunately these devices are using slow low power processors so converting the photos takes some time. Each photo has 5 thumbnails of different sizes.

What this script does is allow you to use the power of your workstation to do the processing for you.
